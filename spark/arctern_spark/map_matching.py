    # TODO: FIX the doc
    """
    Tests whether there is a road within the given ``distance`` of all ``points``. The points do not need to be part of a continuous path.
    Parameters
    ----------
    roads : GeoSeries
        Sequence of LINGSTRING objects.
    points : GeoSeries
        Sequence of POINT objects.
    distance : double, optional
        Searching distance around the points, by default 100.0.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        A Series that contains only boolean value that indicates whether there is a road within the given ``distance`` of all ``points``.
        * *True*: The road exists.
        * *False*: The road does not exist.

    -------
