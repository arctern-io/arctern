## Overview

Arctern is a fast scalable spatial-temporal analytics framework. 

Scalability is key to building productive data science pipelines. To address the scalability challenge, we launched Arctern, an open source spatial-temporal analytic framework for boosting end-to-end data science performance. Arctern aims to improve scalability from two aspects: 

* Unified data analytic and processing interface across different platforms, from laptops to clusters and cloud.
* Rich and consistent algorithms and models, including trajectory processing, spatial clustering and regression, etc., across different data science pipeline stages.

## Arctern's approach and current progress

We adopt GeoPandas‘s interface and plan to build the GeoDataFrame/GeoSeries that scale both up and out. On top of GeoDataFrame/GeoSeries, we will develop a consistent spatial-temporal algorithm set across execution environments.

We have now developed an efficient multi-thread GeoSeries implementation, and the distributed version is in progress. In the latest version 0.2.0, Arctern achieves 24x speed up against GeoPandas. Even under single-thread execution, Arctern outperforms GeoPandas 7x on average. The detailed evaluation results are illustrated in the figure below.

We are also conducting experimental GPU acceleration for spatial-temporal data analysis and rendering. By now Arctern provides six GPU-accelerated rendering methods and eight spatial-relation operations, which outperform their CPU-based counterparts with up to 36x speed up.

In the next few releases, our team will focus on:

- Developing a distributed version of GeoSeries. Our first distributed implementation of GeoDataFrame/GeoSeries will be based on Spark. It is developed in sync with Spark 3.0 since its preview release. Spark's supports on GPU scheduling and column-based processing is highly in line with our idea of high-performance spatial-temporal data processing. Besides, the introduced Koalas interface offers a promising option for implementing consistent GeoDataFrame/GeoSeries interfaces on Spark.
- Enriching our spatial-temporal algorithm sets. We will concentrate on KNN search and trajectory analysis in the project's early stages.
